# A1. Annex {.page_break_before}

The Quality Criteria described in this document follows a technology-agnostic approach, as such the
choice of tools and services to implement their verification and the code workflow, is up to the
team or community developing and/or using a given software.

The annex describes the implementation of how the Quality Criteria detailed in this document can be
verified. The technical implementation is achieved through the SQA as a Service (SQAaaS) platform,
being developed in the framework of the EOSC-Synergy project described in Deliverable 3.2
[@doi:10.20350/digitalCSIC/12721]). It details the architecture and set of components of the
platform.

This annex details the code workflow, the tools and services used to achieve the verification of
the Criteria.

## A1.1. Code workflow

The code workflow is shown in Figure @fig:workflow. It depicts a real case example, Github is used
for several purposes that will be described below. The workflow start when the developer branches
the code to implement a given new feature or fix, after the implementation the Pull Request triggers
a CI pipeline in the Jenkins service.

In the Jenkins service, several checks are performed, both on the code (static), such as code style
linting, as well as dynamic tests such as unit and harness tests. To perform functional tests that
may include API tests in case of a service, the packages will need to be built (delivery), and
automatically deployed into a running state. In the case shown, the configuration is done with
ansible roles and playbooks.

The Pull Request is updated with the results of the tests, thus notifying the developer team that
they can proceed with the review and, if approved, with the release process where the branch is
merge into the main production branch.

## A1.2. Services

The SQAaaS platform can be used to compose custom Jenkins pipelines in an easy way, in order to
implement all necessary checks of the baseline criteria.

Table @tbl:services shows the list of tools and services used for the source code management as well
as to implement the verification of the Quality Criteria detailed in this document.

The main service used for Software source code management has been Github. It uses git as Version
Control System, branching and tag management. Additionally has an issue tracker for bugs, requests
and enhancements and the mechanism of Pull Requests for code review and discussion of changes.

Ansible and Ansible-Galaxy are used in many software frameworks as deployment and configuration
tools.

The software is packed/built into executable artifacts that can be RPMs (case of RedHat and
derivative OS), DEBs (case of Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives) and in many cases containers such as
Docker images.

The artifacts are provided, in general, by public repositories and most notably Docker Hub
[@url:https://hub.docker.com/] in the case of Docker images. Other common repositories are PyPI
[@url:https://pypi.org/] for python SW and Maven [@url:https://maven.apache.org/] for Java.

Regarding the CI/CD automation, Jenkins pipelines can be easily composed through the SQAaaS platform
and put into the git repositories to be used by the Jenkins CI service to perform the tests. The
tools used in the CI automation are shown in section A1.2.
