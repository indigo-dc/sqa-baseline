## A1. Annex

The Quality Criteria described in this document is abstract, as such the choice of tools
and services to implement their verification is up to the team or community developing
and/or using a given software.

The annex describes the implementation of how the Quality Criteria detailed in this
document can be verified, and as has been used in several European projects. It details the
code workflow, the tools and services used to achieve the verification of the Criteria.

### A1.1. List of tools and services

Table @tbl:services show the list of tools and services used to implement the verification of the
Quality Criteria detailed in this document.
