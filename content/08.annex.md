# A1. Annex {.page_break_before}

The Quality Criteria described in this document follows a technology-agnostic approach, as such the
choice of tools and services to implement the code workflow, followed by the verification &
validation processes, is up to the team or community developing and/or using a given software.

This annex describes an implementation approach to help software developers cover the Quality
Criteria detailed in this document.

## A1.1. Code workflow

The code workflow is shown in Figure @fig:workflow. It depicts a real case example, Github is used
for several purposes that will be described below. The workflow starts when the developer branches
the code to implement a given new feature or fix, after the implementation the Pull Request triggers
a CI pipeline in the Jenkins service.

In the Jenkins service, several checks are performed, both on the code (static), such as code style
linting, as well as dynamic tests such as unit and harness tests. To perform functional tests that
may include API tests in case of a service, the packages will need to be built (delivery), and
automatically deployed into a running state. In the case shown, the configuration is done with
ansible roles and playbooks.

The Pull Request is updated with the results of the tests, thus notifying the developer team that
they can proceed with the review and, if approved, with the release process where the branch is
merge into the main production branch.

## A1.2. Verification & Validation (V&V) {.page_break_before}

Once having the code workflow, the next step is to shape the V&V processes in order to ensure that
the software does "the right things right". One way to address them is to rely on CI/CD pipelines
that encompass the series of checks that will be executed automatically for each change done in
the code, driven by the agreed code workflow (see A1.1).

There are multiple technological solutions to compose CI/CD pipelines. The **SQA as a Service
(SQAaaS)** platform[^1] aids developers in such task, with the additional benefit of being 100%
aligned with the criteria being described in this document. The SQAaaS solution relies on Jenkins
code pipelines [@url:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/] and allows developers to use either
a graphical (web-based) or code-based approach to define the work to be performed in each stage of
the CI/CD pipeline.

[^1]: The SQAaaS platform is being developed in the framework of the EOSC-Synergy project described
in Deliverable 3.2 [@doi:10.20350/digitalCSIC/12721]). It details the architecture and set of
components of the platform.

## A1.3. Services

As it can be seen in Figure @fig:workflow, multiple services take part in the execution of the
CI/CD pipelines. Table @tbl:services shows the list of services used for the source code management
as well as to implement the V&V of the Quality Criteria detailed in this document.

One of the most popular services for Software source code management is Github. It is uses Git
as the Version Control System, branching and tag management. Additionally has an issue tracker for
bugs, requests and enhancements and the mechanism of Pull Requests for code review and discussion
of changes.

Ansible and Ansible-Galaxy are used in many software frameworks as deployment and configuration
tools.

The software is packed/built into executable artifacts that can be RPMs (case of RedHat and
derivative OS), DEBs (case of Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives) and in many cases containers such as
Docker images.

The artifacts are provided, in general, by public repositories and most notably Docker Hub
[@url:https://hub.docker.com/] in the case of Docker images. Other common repositories are PyPI
[@url:https://pypi.org/] for python SW and Maven [@url:https://maven.apache.org/] for Java.

Regarding the CI/CD automation, Jenkins pipelines can be easily composed through the SQAaaS platform
and put into the git repositories to be used by the Jenkins CI service to perform the tests. The
tools used in the CI automation are shown in section A1.2.
