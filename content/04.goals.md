# 2. Goals

1. Set the base of minimum SQA criteria that a software developed within EOSC development project
   MUST fulfill.

2. Enhance the visibility, accessibility and distribution of the produced source code through the
   alignment to the Open Source Definition [@https://opensource.org/osd].

3. Promote code style standards to deliver good quality source code emphasizing its readability and
   reusability.

4. Improve the quality and reliability of software by covering different testing methods at
   development and pre-production stages.

5. Propose a change-based driven scenario where all new updates in the source code are continuously
   validated by the automated execution of the relevant tests.

6. Adopt an agile approach to effectively produce timely and audience-specific documentation.

7. Lower the barriers of software adoption by delivering quality documentation and the utilization
   of automated deployment solutions.

8. Encourage secure coding practices and security static analysis at the development phase while
   providing recommendations on external security assessment.
