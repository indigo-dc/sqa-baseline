## Introduction and Purpose

This document has been tailored upon the recommendations and requirements found
in the Initial Plan for Software Management and Pilot Services deliverable
[@url:https://owncloud.indigo-datacloud.eu/index.php/s/yDklCrWjKnjutVA],
produced by the INDIGO-DataCloud project. These guidelines evolved throughout
the projectâ€™s lifetime and are being extended in the
EOSC-Synergy, DEEP-Hybrid-DataCloud and eXtreme DataCloud subsequent projects. The result is
a consolidated Software Quality Assurance (SQA) baseline criteria emanated
from the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), which aims to outline the SQA
principles to be considered in the upcoming software development efforts within
the European research community, and continuously evolve in order to be aligned
with future software engineering practices and security recommendations.
