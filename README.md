## Motivation

Research software development and maintenance often suffers from a lack of
quality assurance realization. This might result from the fact that the
different actors involved are either not aware of the benefits that applying
quality practices bring along, or not keen to adhere to them as they might
increase the burden of the software life cycle.

The main purpose of this document is to _provide a lightweight and practical
approach_ to educate and, ultimately, achieve quality in the development of
research software.

The Common Software Quality Assurance Baseline Criteria _establishes the
minimum viable set of quality requirements_ that shall be covered when tackling
any software development project, but mainly oriented to research. Additional
best practices and recommendations are also defined to increase the value
--e.g. reliability-- of the final product. In order to discern among them, the
[RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) convention is used along the
document, adding adequate information about the criticality of each
requirement.

## Open Collaboration

The current baseline has been elaborated and extended based on the first-hand
experiences extracted from several European-funded research projects for
software development.

We aim to consolidate the quality guidelines as a reference point for future
research projects, setting a path for sustainability and knowledge transfer.
This goal can only be achieved through a open and collaborative effort. __Any
contribution is welcomed and will be considered for inclusion.__
