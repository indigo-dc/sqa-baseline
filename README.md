## Motivation

Research software development and maintenance often suffers from a lack of
quality assurance realization. This might result from the fact that the
different actors involved are either not aware of the benefits that applying
quality practices bring along, or not keen to adhere to them as they might
increase the burden on the software life cycle. Thus, the main purpose of this
document is to _provide a lightweight and practical approach_ to educate and,
ultimately, achieve quality in the development of research software.

The Common Software Quality Assurance Baseline Criteria _establishes the
minimum viable set of quality requirements_ that shall be covered when tackling
any software development project, but mainly oriented to research. Additional
best practices and recommendations are also defined to increase the value
--reliability, interoperability-- of the final product. In order to discern
among them, the [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) convention is
used throughout the document, thus adding adequate information about the
criticality of each requirement.

## Open Collaboration

The current baseline has been elaborated and extended based on the first-hand
experiences extracted from several European-funded research projects for
software development. We aim to consolidate the quality guidelines as a
reference point for future research projects, setting a path for sustainability
and knowledge transfer. This goal can only be achieved through a open and
collaborative effort. Consequently, __any contribution is welcomed and will be
considered for inclusion.__
